# DSCI_532_group-106_supermarket
A python app by Reiko Okamoto, Haoyu Su, and Monique Wong

## Description 
The app contains a landing page that shows four heatmaps of total sales, transaction count, average spend and average customer satisfaction respectively. Users can have a very intuitive comparison of the quantities of those variables in different business time and then decide on what specific time they want to explore more in. From a tab list, users can select which store of the supermarket branch they are interested in. From a dropdown list, users can select the time period they want to look at, by different weekdays (i.e. Monday to Sunday) and then by different parts of the day (i.e. morning, afternoon, evening). After selection, the interface will display four bar plots that show the distribution of total sales, transaction, average spend, average customer satisfaction for that specific time you selected. All 8 plots will be shown on one page so that users can do a comprehensive comparison and make staffing decisions.
