## 1. Motivation and purpose
Managers of supermarkets can influence the profitability of their supermarket in a number of ways. One of the deicisions they have to make from week to week is how to staff their stores. Optimal staffing levels means not overstaffing in periods of time of low customer traffic and not understaffing when there is potential for high customer traffic. Deciding how many staff to have at a given point in time should consider not only customer traffic but also how much customers spend and how satisfied customers are during those times. A manager may choose to staff less in times of low spending or when customers are already highly satisfied. 

We propose to build a dashboard that allows a manager to visualize historical data on customer traffic, average spend and customer satisfaction on different days of the week and times during the day. In order to determine which department to staff, we will also build functionality to allow managers to view traffic, spend and satisfaction data by department. 

## 2. Description of the data
What we are going to look at is the quarterly sales data of three branches of the supermarket company located in three different cities. The dataset contains 1000 computer-generated customer purchase records with 17 variables that describe the the location of supercenters where consumption take place (`City`, `Branch`), the date and time of purchase (`Date`, `Time`), the identification number of each successful checkout (`Invoice ID`), the quantity of goods purchased by a customer (`Quantity`), the total price and the average spending (`Total`, `Unit price`), the general item categorization group (`Product line`), the payment methods (`Payment`), whether the customer has a membership (`Customer type`) and the customer satisfaction scores on the overall shopping experience (`Rating`).

## 3. Research questions and usage scenarios
The overarching research question we are interested in is:
> For which days of the week, time of day and departments can staffing be improved?
