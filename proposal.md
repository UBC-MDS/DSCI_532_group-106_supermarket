## 1. Motivation and purpose
Managers of supermarkets can influence the profitability of their supermarket in a number of ways. One of the deicisions they have to make from week to week is how to staff their stores. Optimal staffing levels means not overstaffing in periods of time of low customer traffic and not understaffing when there is potential for high customer traffic. Deciding how many staff to have at a given point in time should consider not only customer traffic but also how much customers spend and how satisfied customers are during those times. A manager may choose to staff less in times of low spending or when customers are already highly satisfied. 

We propose to build a dashboard that allows a manager to visualize historical data on customer traffic, average spend and customer satisfaction on different days of the week and times during the day. In order to determine which department to staff, we will also build functionality to allow managers to view traffic, spend and satisfaction data by department. 

## 2. Description of the data

## 3. Research questions and usage scenarios
The overarching research question we are interested in is:
> For which days of the week, time of day and departments can staffing be improved?
