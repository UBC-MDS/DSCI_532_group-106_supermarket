## 1. Motivation and purpose
Shoppers have a choice with regard to the supermarket at which they shop - competition for the customers' dollars can be intense. As a result, supermarkets use a variety of techniques to lure customers in customers. These techniques include varying the products they carry, changing the layout of the store and improving customer satisfaction. Another important tactic is offering promotions or sales at the store. 

The decision of what promotion to offer needs to be made frequently, usually at least from week to week. This decision impacts customer traffic (i.e. the number of customers who visit the supermarket) and the amount they spend once they are there. It is certainly a decision that can be informed by data.

We believe that supermarket managers want to offer strategic targeted promotions. While across-the-board promotions such as 10% off all items will intice more customers to the store, thereby increasing transactions, the store could experience a noticeable decrease in profits due to the promotion. By understanding trends in customer traffic and spending by store, we want to equip managers with a tool to target promotions to specific stores, days of the week, timse of day and product lines. We also aim to empower managers to offer promotions specific to membership holders and customers using a specific type of payment. We propose building a dashboard that visualizes these trends, allowing managers to make well-informed decisions.
